When I was a 10th grade, I became extremely close with a teacher who I still talk to today on the regular. ","On teacher that I trusted very well went behind my bad to talk to another teacher about me after I broke down while aiding for her. While it was the right thing for her to do because I was not in the right mental status and needed help, she shouldn’t have taken what I had shared with her an brought it to one of my other teachers.",20,Female,White

In highschool I then did some volunteering for her and we stayed in touch. ",This experience made me realize that most teachers truly care about their students and they want them to succeed. I think I also broke out of my shell a little and became more outspoken and talkative with my teachers. ,I can’t think of anything in particular.,21,Female,White

However, I have quite a small stomach, and our grade had to eat lunch last every day. I would get very hungry around 11am, and after explaining to my Latin teacher that I was having a hard time focusing in his class (around 11) because I was always so hungry, he allowed me to discreetly have a snack whenever I needed to. Even when I accidentally spilled a bag of goldfish on the floor, which is something he should have written me up and given me a detention for (that was the rule for being caught eating in class, and I clearly broke his rule about being discreet), he continued to allow me to have snacks. This may seem like a really small thing, but it showed me that he was on my side and I could trust him to show me kindness and compassion.","This experience showed me that many teachers will bend the rules if you are a good student and looking for a rule-bend for a good reason- teachers are not simply mindless robots that follow everything admin says. Having that trust helped me out many times in high school, when I had much bigger issues than just a spilled bag of goldfish.","My music teacher in 7th grade told me about how a lot of the teachers would basically gossip about students, trying to guess which ones were ""dating"" or which friends were fighting. I had never thought about teachers paying that close attention to our personal lives, and it made me super self conscious about my interactions with my friends and my ""boyfriend"" at the time. I am positive he told me that because he thought I would be amused by it, but it horrified me to known that many of my teachers could be talking about me behind my back- even the ones I liked a lot.",19,Female,White

My teacher talked to me and communicated with me about it to make me feel more comfortable with going and that there was nothing wrong with it. They made me feel like it was okay to be in speech and that if anything went wrong they would be there to help.",It made me view teachers as people who are willing to help you. ,In middle school I had an art teacher yell at me and tell me that I was going to fail his class since I had to leave early every day to go to track practice at the high school. It was already communicated with counselors and both of the teachers it would be effecting (including the art teacher) of why I would miss and that it was okay for me to miss part of class. I lost trust in him because he knew the reason why I was leaving every day and I finished all of my projects before they were due but he singled me out in front of the class to say what a bad student I was. ,20,Female,White

It's not that I distrusted any of them, but it never really went past a professional student-teacher type of relationship. If I have to give an answer then I would say the teacher I had the closest connection to was my 11th grade history teacher. He was a younger instructor so he had the ability to relate to the kids more than the other instructors - he understood pop culture references, he was able to make genuinely funny jokes, and every now and then he would discuss a little of his personal life. He seemed to be truly interested in what students did and liked which made him an easy person to get along with. Again, I don't know if this counts as trusting, but it's a connection nonetheless.","I was always able to understand that teachers are people, but he really helped me to understand how much of a person he actually was. Since he was able to relate to us as young people (not just students) we were able to see him as a man (not just a teacher).","I remember this one instance in which an instructor I had years ago was let go from his teaching position because he sent somewhat inappropriate emails to a few students. To be very clear, they were not absurdly obscene, but they were questionable. The situation as a whole just made me confused and wanted him to be okay since it didn't seem like him.",21,Female,Multi-racial
